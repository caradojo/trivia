Trivia kata - C# version
========================

It can be used with Visual Studio or Visual Code (including on Linux/MacOS).

Visual Studio
-------------

"Ideal" setup would include :
- [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (for academic/students/training, you can request a free licence)
- [NCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/)

I you don't have DotNetCore, remove the corresponding project to avoid compilation errors.

Visual Code
-----------

Need to install DotNetCore (1.0 at least).

Add the C# extensions in VSCode.

Open the Trivia.sln file with "omnisharp" VSCode command.
